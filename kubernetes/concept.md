# Kubernetes
Kubernetes (often shortened to K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

* **Containers:** 
- Lightweight packages that contain everything an application needs to run (code, libraries, dependencies, etc.) <br>
        &rarr; self-contained boxes for your apps. 
        
* **Kubernetes:** This is the system that manages and orchestrates those containers. It ensures they run where and when you want, and have the resources they need.

**Here's a breakdown of the core concepts:**

* **Cluster:** A set of machines (physical or virtual) called nodes that run your containerized applications.
* **Node:** A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Pod:** The smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes. It represents a running process (or group of processes) in your cluster and holds one or more containers.
* **Deployment:**  Manages the rollout and updates of your application. You describe the desired state (e.g., 3 replicas of your app container), and the Deployment makes sure it happens.
* **Service:**  A way to expose your application to the network (internal or external). It provides a stable IP address and load balancing for your pods, even if they die and get replaced.

**Why use Kubernetes?**

* **Scalability:** Easily scale your applications up or down based on demand.
* **High Availability:**  Ensures your applications are always running, even if some nodes fail.
* **Portability:** Run your applications on any infrastructure (on-premises, cloud, hybrid).
* **Efficiency:** Optimizes resource utilization by packing containers onto nodes efficiently.

**Key benefits:**

* **Simplified deployment:** Kubernetes automates the deployment and management of your applications.
* **Increased productivity:** Developers can focus on building apps, not managing infrastructure.
* **Reduced costs:** Efficient resource utilization leads to lower infrastructure costs.
* **Improved reliability:** Kubernetes ensures your applications are always running and available.

**To get started with Kubernetes, you can:**

* **Use a managed Kubernetes service:** Cloud providers like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offer managed Kubernetes clusters.
* **Set up your own cluster:** You can install Kubernetes on your own infrastructure using tools like `kubeadm` or `minikube`.

There are many online resources available to help you learn Kubernetes, including tutorials, documentation, and courses.
